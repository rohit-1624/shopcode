# shopcode (or e-commerce website)
Welcome to my e-commerce website! This project is built to provide a seamless online shopping experience with secure payment integration.
I have created an E-commerce shopping website with components, routers, etc. using React.js, Tailwind CSS and used Firebase for backend storage/access of data and integrated payment gateway Razorpay for collecting secure payments from customers. There is also Admin Panel introduced which can be accessed only by the admin which makes it more secure.

## Features
- **User Authentication** - Login and signup functionality.
- **Product Listing** - Displays products with categories and filters.
- **Shopping Cart** - Add, remove, and update products in the cart.
- **Admin Panel** - Manage products, orders, and users.
- **Secure Payments** - Integrated with Razorpay for transactions.
- **Database & Hosting** - Firebase for real-time database and authentication.
- **Responsive Design** - Optimized for all devices.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js** - JavaScript library for building UI.
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
